ENGG1300 Assignment 1

For grading, compile and run assignment1.c within the Project 1 folder, all file names are hard coded into their respective code. 

29th April 2019.
There is a assisgnment1-1.c flile included it was created from assignment1.c in response to the email from brenton on mon 29th about sub cipher functionality. Had to work so couldnt spend any time actually working it properly. VERY annoyed.

I dont expect much from the assignment1-1.c, it has a tweaked cipher table but is not tested.
